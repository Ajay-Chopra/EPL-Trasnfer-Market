# Analyzing Transfer Market Inefficiencies in the English Premier League #

	
  
  In this project, I aim to highlight prevalent inefficiencies in the player transfer market of the English Premier League (EPL), the most popular professional soccer league in the world. During the winter and summer transfer windows, clubs in the EPL spend an average of $1.5 billion purchasing players from other teams. However, consistent analysis shows that transfer spending has little correlation with competitive success, suggesting that many clubs spend their money inefficiently.
	
  I use three main data sets for analysis. The first tracks wage spending, transfer spending, final league position and performance statistics (compiled by Opta Sports) of clubs in the EPL over the past five seasons. The second is a list of all players purchased by clubs in the EPL over the same period along with their transfer fee, provided it was disclosed. Each player is measured on parameters of age, number of games played and the same set of performance statistics used in the team-level data. The last data set is a comprehensive ranking of all professional soccer players using data from the videogame FIFA 2018, published by EA Sports.
  
 
### Summary of Results ###

  Upon analyzing the data, I conclude that clubs in the EPL engage in three major transfer market inefficiencies. First, they consistently undervalue defensive players, while overvaluing offensive players. Second, they misjudge the offensive value of strikers, using misleading statistics such as number of goals scored instead of more accurate measurements. Lastly, clubs focus too highly on spending a large amount of money on one player, even though such a purchase does not lead to a higher league position.
